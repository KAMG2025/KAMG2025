## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**KAMG2025/KAMG2025** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software engineer (Northeastern CS '92) turned SAHM. Looking to skill up and break back into tech after a long caregiving/volunteering break. So basically a reboot!  

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Github, C#, and .net 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my resume, or my kids.  
- ğŸ“« How to reach me:  KathrynAMG2025@proton.me
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play piano, keyboards, and analog synths.  My software experience specializes in waveform generation.
